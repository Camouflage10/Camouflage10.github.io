                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>First solo project that I thought would help me complete later projects. Later i would find that I had to spend money to put this on the appple store.</p>
                <h2>description</h2>
                <p>This project would start with a start with a home page and you could create a project/task then give it attributes such as a due date, difficulty in the form of a color(easy-green,medium-yellow,hard-red), and name. The project organizer could be used to add tasks and keep track of progress.</p>
